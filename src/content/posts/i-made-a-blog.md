# I Made a Blog

Hello. I made a blog for [Haxmas](https://haxmas.hackclub.com) Day 11 (run by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)).

Truly mind-blowing stuff, I know.

## Techy Stuff
So yeah. I used Astro and Markdown. And maybe some other stuff. idk.

I also modified the css to make it look cooler - stuff like the bars next to the headings (if you didnt already notice them), and the cards on the posts page etc.

## Final Thoughts
Wow. I am amazed you bothered to read this far. Thanks for taking the time to fully digest the magnitude of my extremely important blog post.
